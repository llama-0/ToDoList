# ToDoList

todo:

1. add 'UNDO' logic
2. fix a bug(?) with unreachable items of size ~4
3. investigate a case with disappearing/preserved data, (when multiple versions of the app lauched successively <- this is probably the cause)
4. check/uncheck on swipe from the END
5. add completed tasks to `Completed number_of_completed_tasks`
